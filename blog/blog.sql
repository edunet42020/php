Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses. The hallmarks of blogging include frequent updates, informal language, and opportunities for readers to engage and start a conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeres an overview of what a blog is, why its popular, and tips for starting your own blog.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Blogging?\r\nThe word blog is actually a shortened form of its original name, weblog. These weblogs allowed early internet users to log the details of their day in diary-style entries. Blogs often allow readers to comment, so as they became more common, communities sprung up around popular blogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Fashion', '2021-04-02', 9),

The buzz around dark chocolate these days is focused on flavonoids and trace minerals, some of the molecules that make cacao a so-called super food. But do you know what those things are, and more importantly, why they matter?\r\n\r\nChocolate is good for you because it makes you happy on a basic, chemical level. Studies have proven this time & time again, but no, the Hersheys and Cadburys bars that are half sugar dont count. But a positive brain response is not the only reason to grab a quality chocolate bar for your post-meal bliss.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Dark Chocolate?\r\nMany countries have a legal definition for each of the three types of chocolate: white, milk, and dark. These definitions basically regulate the minimum amount of cacao derivatives and dairy which must be present in each chocolate, as well as a nutritive carbohydrate sweetener content maximum. For its part, dark chocolate is actually not yet explicitly defined by the FDA, which rather chooses to define the term chocolate, allowing companies to characterize their chocolate products however theyd like.\r\n\r\n', 'Food', '2021-04-04', 10),
